## Part 1 ##

What about your API/design is intended to be flexible?
 -  The interaction between the front end and the backend is inteneded to be very flexible, via the model that connects to the two components together. I hold the necessary methods and data structures required by the front end in back end.
How is your API/design encapsulating your implementation decisions?
   - By having a well definied model class to interface between the front end and the backend, we can encapsulate how we implement our front-end and backend components, keeping the two independent of each other.
What exceptions (error cases) might occur in your part and how will you handle them (or not, by throwing)?
    - The most notable exceptions which may occur are bad Slogo commands that can't be parsed. I will handle them by throwing beautiful exceptions to the front-end, so they can be diplayed to the user. 
Why do you think your API/design is good (also define what your measure of good is)?
    - My measure of a good API is a design that is thorough, flexible, and easy to understand. We kept these these guidelines in mind when designing our API, which is why we are using clear and well definied methods, a concrete point of interface, and heavy use of encapsualtion.

TODO

How do you think Design Patterns are currently represented in the design or could be used to help improve the design?
    -
How do you think the "advanced" Java features will help you implement your design?
    -
What feature/design problem are you most excited to work on?
    -
What feature/design problem are you most worried about working on-
    -
Come up with at least five use cases for your part (it is absolutely fine if they are useful for both teams).
